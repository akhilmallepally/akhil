<h3>Using GIT from command line in a GNU/Linux OS.<h3
<p>Let us try to clone a remote project and do some experiments using GIT commands in a GNU/Linux OS.</p>

<p>First off, you are here because you already have a gitlab account, atleast I assumee so. If not, don't delay. Sign up. I tried to make this as engaging as possible, as you should feel the author is explaining you rather reading an article</p>

<p>You have your GITLAB account setup now. Now, let's go to terminal, CTRL+ALT+T will take you to terminal/konsole.</p>

<p>Just want to type some commands. Ho! Wait. You need to have some basic requirements to be there beforehand. But what are they? How would you know, right! I help you dive in. 
Just see if the below conditions are satisfied. Else, click on them.</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Working Linux Environment.</li>
<li>2. GIT installed.</li>
<li>3. Configuring your GIT with SSH keys.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, we start from very basic stuff..</p>

<p>
1. Search for the GIT version by<br>
    git --version<br>
    <br>
    It should display *git version 2.17.1*<br>
    <br>
    If GIT is not installed in your local, don't worry, here it is. *https://about.gitlab.com/install/*
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
2. It’s time to configure in your local system.<br>
<br>
   git config --global user.name "akhil" <br>             
    git config --global user.email "akhil@swecha.net"<br>
    <br>
Note : --global tells your Gitlab to use this information always for anything you do on your Computer.<br>
<br>
  Good. Now the configuration is done. But how do I check whether it’s done or not? Just try this and see what you get<br>
  <br>
	git config --global --list
	
	</p>
	<p>
3. Cloning part is on the way. It’s very simple.<br>
<br>
    git clone code.swecha.org/akhil/Project-name . <br>
    <br>
	The ‘.’ in the above command says to clone the project into the current directory<br>
	<br>
	Tadaa! The project is cloned.<br>

Note : Try   git remote -v  and  git branch -b, they gives the information about the remote  repository and banches respectively.
</p>
4. Everything is fine, does the git knows the folders that we have just cloned is a repository.<br> No, because it’s just a folder in my Local. That’s where initialising part comes.<br>
<br>
	git init <br>
	<br>
	This command instructs git to start to track that folder/directory as a repository.
	
<p>5. Commit changes :<br>
	create an empty file through terminal.<br>
		touch test and write some code or text in the file.<br>
		
	To check the changes made/current status :<br>
		git status<br>
		
	To add all the files :<br>
		git add -A<br>
		
	In case, if you want to add only one or specific file<br>
		git add *file name*<br>
		
	Let’s commit these changes :<br>

		git commit -m “first commit”
</p>

<p>6. We are almost done. The final steps are to push the code into the original repo. <br>
		
		git push origin master </p>
		
		
<p>This is a basic idea that you should have when you work on a GIT using commands. To explore more, click here. </p>
