/set up python3 as default in ubuntu/debian

type python in your terminal

Mostly, it will show 2.7

now our task is to change this . because latest version of python is 3.9


install python3 if not installed already 


sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install python3


install pip3, if not already installed 

sudo apt install python3-pip


In shell :

echo "alias python=python3" >> ~/.bash_aliases


source ~/.bash_aliases

But this will cause an error... let's see what that error is.
